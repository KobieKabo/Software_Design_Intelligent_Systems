# Automobile Fuel Efficiency Prediction Using Linear Regression

This repository contains Project 1 for COE 379L - Software Design for Responsible Intelligent Systems - at the University of Texas. The objective of this project was to forecast the fuel efficiency of automobiles utilizing a linear regression machine learning model. The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (`Mpg_LinearRegressionModel.ipynb`) detailing the data preparation, model training, and analysis process, along with a PDF report summarizing the project's insights and conclusions.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on applying exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques to predict car fuel efficiency. It demonstrates proficiency with Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization, and scikit-learn for model implementation.

## Data Preparation

The analysis began with the automobiles dataset, which includes 398 entries and variables like mpg, cylinders, displacement, and horsepower. The preparation phase involved cleaning the data, handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and one-hot encoding categorical data to make the dataset suitable for modeling.

## Linear Regression Model Fitting

The core of the project involved training a linear regression model to predict the fuel efficiency (mpg) of a vehicle based on its characteristics. The process included splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting the model to the training data, and evaluating its performance on unseen data.

## Model Analysis

The model's effectiveness was assessed using the RÂ² score, revealing strong and consistent performance in both training and testing phases. This suggests that the model has successfully captured the underlying patterns without overfitting, making it a reliable tool for predicting fuel efficiency.

## Insights and Conclusion

The project produced a linear regression model capable of accurately estimating the fuel efficiency of automobiles. The analysis highlighted key factors influencing fuel efficiency and underscored the importance of careful data preparation and model evaluation.
