# Breast Cancer Recurrence Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project was to develop a deeper understanding of the hyperparameterization of machine learning classification models, specifically for modeling the recurrence of breast cancer within patients. The dataset used contains variables such as age, degree of malignancy, tumor size etc. Three different supervised learning models were used to predict if a patient would have recurrenct breast cancer. The models emphasize on minimizing false negatives as a way to not impact patients in a life threatening way. Thus focusing on increasing recall of our models

## Models Used

- Decision Tree Classifier: A tree structure method emplyoing IF ... THEN statements to model the data & predict future values.

- K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier (KNN): A non-parametric method that classifies cases based on their similarity to other instances.

- Logistic Regression: A statistical model that estimates probabilities using a logistic function.
